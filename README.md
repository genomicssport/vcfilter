# vcfilter

- asynchronous population scale variant filter. It reports stats on the top of the file and gives you the following for each file in the folder:
- sample1.alt-stats: stats on alt allele
- sample1.alt-unique-variants.txt: unique alt allele in that vcf to see after filtering which are the variant types present.
- sample1.filtereds: filtered file according to the variants and coverage or quality or zygosity
- sample1.ref-stats: stat on ref allele
- sample1.ref-unique-variants.txt: unique ref allele in that vcf to see after filtering which are the variant types present.
